# coem-web

The Coem website, containing all relevant information and documentation about the language.

## Setup

This website is currently using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so no need to install anything, but you do need a local server so the assets link all work properly! I usually just run:

```
python -m http.server
```

which will spin up a server on localhost:8000 which is an address you can navigate to in your browser.
