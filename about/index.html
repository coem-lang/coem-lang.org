      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>On creating a poetic programming language</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Coem (a portmanteau of “code” and “poem”) is an esoteric programming language that seeks to explore ways that poetry can be made functional, and ways that code can be made poetic. Drawing inspiration from codeworks, electronic literature, and critical code studies, it strives to bring together the areas of programming, poetry, linguistics, and typography in ways that are interesting, beautiful, and emotional.</p>

      <h4>Codeworks</h4>
      <p>Codeworks are a broad category that includes code poetry and esoteric programming languages.</p>
      <p>Code poetry is poetry written using the conventions of various programming languages, whether or not they compile and run as valid programs in the language.</p>
      <p>Esoteric programming languages—esolangs, for short—are often hobbyist projects that challenge and play with the norms of computing. There is an open <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Main_Page">wiki</a> that continues to document new esolangs, and Daniel Temkin maintains a blog on <a href="https://esoteric.codes/">esoteric.codes</a>, featuring detailed write-ups about esolangs and interviews with their creators. Examples of esolangs that have particularly inspired this project are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sukanya Aneja’s <a href="https://inverse.website/">in:verse</a>, “a programming language and environment for exploring the conflux of poetry, visuals, mathematics and code”,</li>
        <li>William Hick’s <a href="https://github.com/wphicks/Esopo">Esopo</a>, a family of “poetically or literarily interesting esoteric programming languages”, and</li>
        <li>Zeb Burke-Conte’s <a href="https://shakespearelang.com/">Shakespeare Programming Language</a>, “designed with the goal of making its source code look like William Shakespeare’s plays”.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Electronic literature</h4>
      <p>Electronic literature is an even broader category that covers much of born-digital works.</p>

      <h4>Critical code studies</h4>
      <p>Pioneered by Mark C. Marino with his seminal <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/critical-code-studies">book</a>, critical code studies describes what it means to critically engage with code.</p>

      <h3>Features</h3>

      <h4>Regular expressions</h4>
      <p>In a paper titled <a href="https://pqueue.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/p-queue-volume-5.pdf">“Regular Expressions as a System of Poetic Notation”</a>, Dan Waber writes about the poetic potential of regular expressions. He describes “a system of notation to augment, to build upon, to multiply the possibilities of language to make nets for catching truth.” “When reading about regular expressions substitute the word ‘means’ wherever the word ‘matches’ occurs and the text will become about poetics.”</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Future</h3>
      <p>This language is currently under development as part of the author’s senior thesis. The author hopes to continue developing it beyond the duration of the course, and invites input and collaboration!</p>
